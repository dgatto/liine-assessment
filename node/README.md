Express API that one can use to find open restaurants based on a day and time. I got to use TDD for this, and it was really fun.

## Getting Started

To get the app running and making calls for restaurants, follow these steps:

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run start`
3. To make a request for restaurants, call to `http://localhost:3000/restaurants/open-by-date/2024-01-11T20:11:18Z`, with a date of your choosing in that ISO-8601 format

## Running tests

To run tests for the app, run the `npm run test` command
